## SID (Student Information Desk)

This is my first ever solo project, written utilising Laravel framework as well as some Vue components. I based the spec off of my employer's helpdesk system.

The basic idea is that a user signs in as student or staff and makes a "call", assigning it to a member of staff. The assigned staff member, as well as the caller, then has various dynamic "action" options based on the current state of the call. Notifications are generated and appear on the user's homepage whenever an update has been made to one of their calls.
